		          			I'm a designer & front-end developer based in Tokyo, designing user-friendly interfaces with simplicity in mind for clients in Japan.

On the digital side, using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript I can create anything from a small static site, to a custom theme built for Wordpress. All projects are produced with SEO in mind making sure you have a great foundation to build on when it comes to being found in Google. I build sites that do not just look good on your desktop PC, but are also fully responsive so it looks and works great on all tablet devices and phones too.
